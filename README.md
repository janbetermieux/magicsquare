This project has the following purposes:

* to study the 3 kinds of magic squares, to better understand the math and logic behind them
* to simply build beautiful 3d geometric figures based on the values of a magic square matrix
* to train myself in 3d c++ programming

Controls:
* arrow keys rotate the matrix
* Page up/down increases the matrix (eg from 3x3 to 4x4 press page up)
* space starts automatic rotating

The project has been developed and tested only on a 64 bit Linux Ubuntu machine with CMAKE.

Magic squares are present all around the world and are often associated with religious / spiritual / numerological properties
They are present in eg "Hindu Yantra" , Freemasonry, Taosism (Pa kua) , Christian, Sufism and Kabalist mysticism.

If you want to read more about that, see my paper "The presence of Magic Squares in history and present"
